# Vibing AI Block Kit

The Vibing AI Block Kit is a comprehensive component library that provides a consistent design system for building interfaces within the Vibing AI platform. This library enables developers to create visually appealing and functionally robust applications that integrate seamlessly with the platform.

## Purpose and Benefits

The Block Kit is designed to:

- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain a unified look and feel across the platform
- **Accelerate Development**: Provide ready-made components for common interface needs
- **Support Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet accessibility standards
- **Enable Theming**: Allow components to adapt to user-selected themes
- **Simplify Maintenance**: Centralize UI logic for easier updates and improvements

## Core Principles

### 1. Composability

Components are designed to work together, allowing developers to combine them in various ways to build complex interfaces from simple building blocks.

### 2. Accessibility

All components adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring that applications built with Block Kit are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

### 3. Responsiveness

Components automatically adapt to different screen sizes and device types, providing a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 4. Themeable

The design system supports customization through themes, allowing components to adapt to light/dark modes and custom color schemes.

### 5. Performance

Components are optimized for performance, with minimal bundle size and efficient rendering to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add the Block Kit to your project:

```bash
npm install @vibing-ai/block-kit
```

### Basic Usage

Import and use components in your application:

```jsx
import { Card, Text, Button } from '@vibing-ai/block-kit';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Text variant="heading">Hello World</Text>
      <Text>This is a simple card component.</Text>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Theming

Apply themes to your components:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@vibing-ai/block-kit/theme';
import { darkTheme } from '@vibing-ai/block-kit/themes';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={darkTheme}>
      <MyComponent />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
