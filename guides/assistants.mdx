## Introduction

Assistants in Vibing AI are intelligent agents that can engage in meaningful conversations, perform tasks, and maintain context over time. With the power of large language models and persistent memory, assistants can provide personalized experiences to your users.

## Creating an Assistant

To create a new assistant, use the `createAssistant` method:

```typescript
import { vibing } from '@vibing/sdk';

// Create a new assistant
const assistant = await vibing.assistants.create({
  name: "Customer Support Agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful customer support agent for Acme Inc. Answer questions about our products and services.",
  metadata: {
    department: "customer_support",
    specialty: "technical_issues"
  }
});

console.log(`Assistant created with ID: ${assistant.id}`);
```

### Assistant Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | A descriptive name for your assistant |
| `instructions` | string | Detailed instructions that define the assistant's behavior |
| `metadata` | object | Optional key-value pairs for organizing assistants |
| `tools` | array | Optional list of tools the assistant can use |

## Retrieving Assistants

Fetch a specific assistant or list all assistants:

```typescript
// Get a specific assistant
const assistant = await vibing.assistants.retrieve('asst_123456789');

// List all assistants
const assistants = await vibing.assistants.list();
```

## Updating Assistants

Modify an existing assistant's properties:

```typescript
const updatedAssistant = await vibing.assistants.update('asst_123456789', {
  name: "Premium Customer Support",
  instructions: "You are a premium support agent for VIP customers. Provide exceptional service.",
  metadata: {
    department: "premium_support",
    priority: "high"
  }
});
```

## Deleting Assistants

Remove an assistant when no longer needed:

```typescript
const deleted = await vibing.assistants.delete('asst_123456789');
```

## Assistant Instructions

Well-crafted instructions are crucial for an assistant's performance. Instructions should:

1. **Define the role** - Specify who the assistant is and what it does
2. **Set boundaries** - Clarify what topics are in/out of scope
3. **Establish tone** - Define the communication style and personality
4. **Provide domain knowledge** - Include essential information for the assistant's role

Example instructions:

```
You are SalesBot, a sales assistant for TechGadgets Inc. 

Your responsibilities:
- Answer questions about our product catalog (smartphones, laptops, accessories)
- Recommend products based on customer needs
- Explain basic technical specifications
- Provide information about pricing and availability

Never:
- Process payments or handle sensitive customer information
- Make promises about delivery dates
- Discuss competitors' products in detail
- Provide technical support for product issues

Maintain a friendly, helpful tone while being concise and accurate. When uncertain, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.
```

## Integrating with Conversations

Assistants are designed to interact with users through conversations:

```typescript
// Create a new conversation with an assistant
const conversation = await vibing.conversations.create({
  assistant_id: 'asst_123456789',
  metadata: {
    user_id: 'user_987654321',
    session_id: 'session_123'
  }
});

// Add a message to the conversation
await vibing.messages.create({
  conversation_id: conversation.id,
  role: 'user',
  content: 'Hello, I need help with my recent order.'
});

// Run the conversation to get the assistant's response
const run = await vibing.runs.create({
  conversation_id: conversation.id
});

// Check run status and get results
const runResult = await vibing.runs.retrieve(conversation.id, run.id);
```

## Specialized Assistant Types

### Customer Support Assistants

```typescript
const supportAssistant = await vibing.assistants.create({
  name: "Support Agent",
  instructions: "You are a customer support agent. Help users troubleshoot problems, answer product questions, and document issues for the support team.",
  metadata: {
    department: "support",
    product_knowledge: ["software", "hardware", "billing"]
  }
});
```

### Content Creation Assistants

```typescript
const contentAssistant = await vibing.assistants.create({
  name: "Content Creator",
  instructions: "You are a content creation assistant. Help users draft blog posts, social media content, and marketing copy. Suggest improvements and variations.",
  metadata: {
    expertise: ["blogging", "social_media", "copywriting"]
  }
});
```

### Research Assistants

```typescript
const researchAssistant = await vibing.assistants.create({
  name: "Research Aid",
  instructions: "You are a research assistant. Help users find information, summarize findings, and organize research notes.",
  metadata: {
    research_domains: ["academic", "market_research", "competitive_analysis"]
  }
});
```

## Working with Assistant Tools

Assistants can be equipped with tools that extend their capabilities:

```typescript
const assistantWithTools = await vibing.assistants.create({
  name: "Data Analyst",
  instructions: "You are a data analysis assistant. Help users interpret data and generate insights.",
  tools: [
    {
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "query_database",
        description: "Query a database to retrieve specific data points",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            query: {
              type: "string",
              description: "SQL query to execute"
            },
            database: {
              type: "string",
              description: "Database to query"
            }
          },
          required: ["query", "database"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific with instructions** - The more detailed your instructions, the better your assistant will perform
2. **Start simple, iterate often** - Begin with basic functionality and refine based on user interactions
3. **Leverage metadata** - Use metadata to organize assistants and provide additional context
4. **Combine with memory** - Use the memory system to create more personalized assistant experiences
5. **Monitor performance** - Regularly review conversations to identify areas for improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Assistant Not Following Instructions

If your assistant isn't behaving as expected:
- Review and refine your instructions to be more specific
- Break complex instructions into clear, separate points
- Check if there are conflicting instructions or goals

### Managing Context Limitations

When dealing with lengthy conversations:
- Use memory to store important information explicitly
- Summarize previous interactions in new instructions
- Create specialized assistants for different parts of a complex workflow
