## Welcome to Vibing AI

Vibing AI is a pioneering AI operating system that orchestrates specialized AI applications while prioritizing user control, privacy, and a seamless experience. Our platform brings together the power of large language models, purpose-specific agents, and a secure memory system to create a unified, intelligent workspace.

At its core, Vibing AI features the **Vibing Super Agent** - a central orchestration layer that delegates to specialized agents and applications while maintaining a coherent user experience. The platform is built on our innovative **Unified Memory System**, which provides persistent, cross-application context while enforcing strict privacy controls.
