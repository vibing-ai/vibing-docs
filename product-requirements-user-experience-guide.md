- **Graceful Degradation:** Handle errors and limitations elegantly without catastrophic failures
- **Appropriate Confidence:** Communicate certainty levels and limitations honestly
- **Verifiable Results:** Make it easy to fact-check or verify AI-generated outputs

### 2.7 Emotional Experience Design

The emotional aspects of Vibing AI's design are as important as the functional elements. These guidelines ensure a positive emotional connection with users:

#### 2.7.1 Core Emotional Qualities

Vibing AI should make users feel:
- **Empowered:** Not replaced or obsolete
- **Confident:** Not confused or overwhelmed
- **In control:** Not manipulated or surveilled

These emotional qualities manifest in the design through:

**Visual Design:**
- Clean, focused interfaces without unnecessary decoration
- Visual hierarchy that emphasizes user content over system elements
- Warm, human-centered color palette and typography
- Subtle animations that convey system status without distraction

**Interaction Patterns:**
- Responses that acknowledge user effort and expertise
- Error messages that offer solutions without blame

- Transitions that respect user attention and cognitive load

**Language & Tone:**
- Conversational but not overly casual
- Helpful without being presumptuous
- Clear about capabilities and limitations
- Respectful of user agency and decision-making

#### 2.7.3 Emotional Anti-Patterns

Vibing AI should consciously avoid experiences that make users feel:
- **Misunderstood:** When the system repeatedly fails to grasp obvious intentions
- **Manipulated:** When persuasive design tactics prioritize system goals over user needs
- **Surveilled:** When personalization reveals uncomfortable awareness of user behavior
- **Dependent:** When the system creates reliance rather than enhancing capability
- **Frustrated:** When capabilities are oversold and underdelivered

## 13. API Standards

### 13.1 Error Handling Format

All error responses follow the RFC 7807 Problem Details format:

```json
{
  "type": "https://vibing.ai/errors/permission-denied",
  "title": "Permission Denied",
  "detail": "The app requested access to project memory but was denied",
  "status": 403,
  "instance": "/apps/123/memory/project"
}
```

Standard fields include:
- `type`: URI reference identifying the error
- `title`: Brief, human-readable summary of the problem
- `detail`: Human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence
- `status`: HTTP status code
- `instance`: URI reference identifying the specific occurrence

This format replaces previous variations (`{code, message, path}` and `{code, message, context}`).

### 13.2 Rate Limit Headers

All API responses include standardized rate limit headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in a period
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time when the current rate limit window resets (in seconds)
- `Retry-After`: The time to wait before making a new request (when rate limited)

### 13.3 Permission Format

The standardized permission format includes mandatory purpose parameters:
```
resource:action:scope;purpose=...;ttl=...
```

Examples:
- `memory:read:project;purpose=generate content;ttl=3600`
- `files:write:document;purpose=save changes;ttl=session`

This explicit purpose declaration provides transparency to users about why permissions are being requested.
